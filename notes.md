 - `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>` have single owners.
 - `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>` allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
 - Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is immutable.

 - `Arc<T>` is the thread-safe equivalent of `Rc<T>`.
 - `Mutex<T>` is essentially locking a value so that only one thread can access it at a time.
